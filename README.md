# Project1-Money-Cashboard

Available on Heroku here (initial load may be slow as Herouku boots) - [here](https://glacial-scrubland-75610.herokuapp.com/) 

This is the first project I undertook during week 5 of the 16 week [CodeClan](http://www.codeclan.com) immersive programming course.

It's a simple budgeting app demonstrating use of these technologies and principles -

- Ruby
- Sinatra
- HTML
- CSS
- PostgreSQL
- TDD

After the project I was keen to be able to demonstrate it without the need for someone to go through a lengthy install / setup process. So I deployed it to heroku, and you can use the app [here](https://glacial-scrubland-75610.herokuapp.com/) -
