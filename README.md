# Project1-Money-Cashboard

This is the first project I undertook during week 5 of the 16 week [CodeClan](http://www.codeclan.com) immersive programming course.

It's a simple budgeting app using these technologies -

- Ruby
- Sinatra
- HTML
- CSS
- PostgreSQL

You can see it running on heroku [here](https://glacial-scrubland-75610.herokuapp.com/transactions) -
